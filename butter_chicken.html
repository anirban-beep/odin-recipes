        <strong>Ingredients</strong> - 
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken without skin</li>
            <li>Yogurt</li>
            <li>fresh garlic</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>spices (garam masala)</li>
        </ul>

    </p>


    <p>
        <strong>Steps</strong> -
        <ol>
            <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.
            </li>
            <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
            <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
            <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.
            </li>
        </ol>
